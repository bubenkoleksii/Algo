- First solution: SimpleLoops
   Time complexity: O(n^2)
   Space complexity: O(1)

- Second solution: ArrayWithCounts
    Time complexity: O(n)
    Space complexity: O(1)

- Third solution: HashSets
    Time complexity: O(n)
    Space complexity: O(n)

**Conclusion:**
It appeared that the second solution is the most effective for this test data,
but if the characters were any and not a-z, the third solution would be better
