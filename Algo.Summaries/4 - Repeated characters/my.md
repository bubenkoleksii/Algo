- First solution: Counter
  - Time complexity: O(n)
  - Space complexity: O(n)

- Second solution: Regex
    - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
    - Space Complexity: O(m), where m is the number of matches found by the regex.

Conclusion: for large strings Counter() is much more effective than regex
